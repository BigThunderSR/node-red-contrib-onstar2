# node-red-contrib-onstar2
A node-red flow for controlling GM OnStar vehicles powered by [onstarjs](https://github.com/samrum/OnStarJS) originally written by [caseyjmorton](https://www.npmjs.com/~caseyjmorton) and published [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-onstar)

This fork is for me to experiment with the capabilities exposed in the original version and to add custom commands as necessary.
